The Kraken (/ˈkreɪkən/ or /ˈkrɑːkən/)[1] is a legendary sea monster of large proportions that is said to dwell off the coasts of Norway and Greenland. The legend may have originated from sightings of Giant squid that are estimated to grow to 12–15 m (40–50 ft) in length, including the tentacles.[2][3] The sheer size and fearsome appearance attributed to the kraken have made it a common ocean-dwelling monster in various fictional works.
