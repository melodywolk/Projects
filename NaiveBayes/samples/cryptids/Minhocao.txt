The minhocão ("big earthworm" in Brazilian Portuguese) is a large earthworm or serpent-like cryptid that allegedly exists in the forests of South and Central America.
The Minhocão is said to resemble a giant, 20 to 50 meter [clarification needed] worm or serpent, with scaly black skin covering its entire body. A member of the Serpentes suborder, this serpent is reported to be ectothermic and have highly mobile jaws and[citation needed] is thought to be a burrowing animal, dwelling in enormous trenches or caves beneath the jungle floor.
