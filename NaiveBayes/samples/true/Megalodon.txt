Megalodon (/ˈmɛɡələdɒn/ MEG-ə-lə-don; meaning "big tooth", from Ancient Greek: μέγας (megas) "big, mighty" and ὀδoύς (odoús), "tooth"—whose stem is odont-, as seen in the genitive case form ὀδόντος, odóntos)[1] is an extinct species of shark that lived approximately 15.9 to 2.6 million years ago, during the Cenozoic Era (middle Miocene to end of Pliocene).[2]

The taxonomic assignment of C. megalodon has been debated for nearly a century, and is still under dispute. The two major interpretations are Carcharodon megalodon (under family Lamnidae) or Carcharocles megalodon (under the family Otodontidae).[3] Consequently, the scientific name of this species is commonly abbreviated C. megalodon in the literature.

C. megalodon is regarded as one of the largest and most powerful predators in vertebrate history,[4] and likely had a profound impact on the structure of marine communities.[5] Fossil remains suggest that this giant shark reached a maximum length of 18 metres (59 ft),[2] and also affirm that it had a cosmopolitan distribution.[3] Scientists suggest that C. megalodon looked like a stockier version of the great white shark, Carcharodon carcharias.[6]
